// Quicksort sorts a in descending order using quicksort algorithm
// (not stable, in-place, extra space log n due to recursion).
// Running time is n log n on average case (random order, no duplicates),
// and nÂ² in worst (already sorted or has many duplicates).
// Note, 3-way quicksort (partition by <, =, >) works well with duplicates (Dutch flag problem).
//
// Quicksort is the fastest general-purpose sort when space is tight:
// it has only a few instructions in its inner loop,
// it does well with cache memories because it most often references data sequentially.

/*
qpartition uses rightmost element as a pivot to separate the elements into two groups.
Index j examines elements from start of the fragment till the pivot (excluding).
Elements between left and i should be >= pivot.
Elements between i+1 and j should be < pivot.

	  9 4 8 3 7
	i j       pivot

	0) 9 >= 7, swap(a[0], a[0]) => 9 4 8 3 7
	1) 4 < 7
	2) 8 >= 7, swap(a[1], a[2]) => 9 8 4 3 7
	3) 3 < 7
	4) move pivot, swap(a[2], a[4]) => 9 8 7 3 4

Another way to pick a pivot is to randomly choose 3 elements and take a median.
This should decrease probability of picking a bad pivot.
